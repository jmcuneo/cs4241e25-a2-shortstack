## Northstar Cafe Waitlist Site
I have always been into making drinks especially in a home cafe setting. This project acts as a waitlist signup for "prospective customers" where they can see the potential menu once it is completed in a flexbox webdev setting. The application assumes the person IS AN ADMIN, which is why I have the admin tables for people to see data. There is not much you need to do, other than input dummy data and see it on the tables. For engagement, my derived data is a personified drink, where it takes their first names and gives them a drink based on that.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Create a two-page application that provides a form for user to submit data and always show the current state of the server-side data. Users can also view the derived/persona data on both ends (index/tables). This uses a full-stack integration with a Node.js HTTP server and has REST design. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Created a unique and distinctive brand for the Northstar Cafe. After doing some research and having a brand in mind that I wanted to create, I focused on a minimalistic and friendly UX design for users. I also wanted to have warm and friendly site, making sure people feel welcome when using such a simple form, which is why the drink persona gamification is also an integral part. The color palette is included in this repo too.

- **Design Achievement 2**: User Testing with a Student
I tested this app with a WPI student to see their thoughts, focusing on them filling out the form and then seeing the data and being able to delete it. I first stated what this was about, then let them roam, and finally feedback. This was tested over Discord.
1. Last Name: Vo
2. Any Problems: None at all; She liked the UI a lot and it reminded her of most sites, which is good.
3. Surprising Comments: "I need my Chai Latte when this cafe opens"
4. Any potential Changes?: Adding more functionality on the tables like an edit function. It would be great to have!

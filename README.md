## Gymnastics Competition Score Tracker

This website is a place where gymnasts (Women's Gymnastics) can store data on the competitions they have competed in (Note: Different events are competed in Men's gymnastics compared to Women's gymnasts). They can add, delete, and edit entries that are displayed in a table on the page. The form collects the name and year of the competition, the level that the gymnast competed at, and the scores for the four events that the gymnast competed. The sever calculates the total score based on the four scores entered and displays that with the rest of the data. The website utilizes the FlexBox layout technique to format the header and the main content of the page. It also utilizes the Quicksand (main text) and Raleway (headers and buttons) fonts. 

**Instructions/User Notes**
- Forms are displayed on the left or center of the page depending on page size.
- All entries that are not buttons can be typed into. 
- In non-pro gymnastics, scores are between 0 and 10 with a specificity of up to three decimal points (ex. 9.325, 8.1, 9.55). This was the standard used when making this site. 
- Links on the bottom of the page send you to pages for official gymnastics organizations and meet track websites. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: All three forms and the data are displayed on the same page. Only one form is displayed at a time and there are buttons to toggle between the different forms and their actions. There is also a media query that switches the display from being on the left of the forms to being underneath the forms when the screen gets smaller width wise.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: All entries in the display table have an edit button that opens a prefilled form that allows users to edit the entry. Data is updated in the table as soon as the user saves the edited information. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: User Test 1
  1. Tested by Mother 
  2. Problems: thought section headers were buttons, did not realize that the form was already displayed on the screen, tried to submit without filling out the whole form, did not understand instruction above first input, 
  3. Comments: when trying to delete an entry, asked if she could select the entry she wanted to delete it by clicking on table entry 
  4. Changes: I would add instructions and a description of the website, add the word "personal" to the title of the page, better highlight the forms themselves, and change the headers to look less like buttons. 
- **Design Achievement 2**: User Test 2
  1. Tested by Sister 
  2. Problems: at first used arrows to increment score numbers and later realized you could type in the box, tried to edit the entry number on the edit form, 
  3. Comments: "It does it for you!" in response to the fact that the site calculates the total score for you, "I know nothing about gymnastics" when first starting to use the site 
  4. Changes: In addition to the changes from test 1, I would bold the (Display Only) note in the edit form.
